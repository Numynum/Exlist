What's the issue?

What version of Exlist were you using?

Did it work before? If so which version?

Tried with other addons disabled?

Any error logs? Make sure you have errors enabled (`/console scriptErrors 1`) or install (recommended) [Bugsack](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/BugSack) and [Buggrabber](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber)
